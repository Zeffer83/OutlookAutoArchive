# Outlook Auto Archive Script

A PowerShell script that automatically archives emails older than a specified number of days from your Outlook Inbox to organized year/month folders.

**Author**: Ryan Zeffiretti  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**License**: MIT

## Features

- **Automatic Email Archiving**: Moves emails older than X days from Inbox to Archive folders
- **Organized Structure**: Creates year/month folder hierarchy (e.g., `Archive\2024\2024-12`)
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Test the script safely without actually moving emails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs of all operations with timestamps
- **Multi-Account Support**: Works with multiple Outlook accounts/stores
- **Smart Folder Detection**: Automatically finds Archive folders in various locations
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Handles duplicate emails intelligently
- **Custom Skip Rules**: Built-in logic to skip specific emails (e.g., monitoring alerts)

## Prerequisites

- Windows with PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Microsoft Outlook installed and configured
- Outlook COM Interop permissions

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Outlook is installed and configured on your system
3. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and customize the settings
4. The script is ready to run - no additional installation required

## Configuration

The script uses a `config.json` file for configuration. Edit this file to customize the script behavior:

```json
{
  "RetentionDays": 14,
  "DryRun": true,
  "LogPath": "%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\OutlookAutoArchiveLogs",
  "GmailLabel": "OutlookArchive",
  "SkipRules": [
    {
      "Mailbox": "MailBox Name",
      "Subjects": ["Message Subject", "Message Subject"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`RetentionDays`**: Number of days to keep emails in Inbox before archiving
- **`DryRun`**: When `true`, shows what would be moved without actually moving emails
- **`LogPath`**: Directory where log files are stored (supports `%USERPROFILE%` variable)
- **`GmailLabel`**: Custom Gmail label name for archive folder (optional)
- **`SkipRules`**: Array of rules to skip specific emails by mailbox and subject patterns

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Run in dry-run mode (recommended first time)
# Edit config.json to set "DryRun": true
.\OutlookAutoArchive.ps1

# Run in live mode (actually moves emails)
# Edit config.json to set "DryRun": false
.\OutlookAutoArchive.ps1
```

### Scheduled Execution

To run automatically, create a Windows Task Scheduler task:

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger (e.g., daily at 2 AM)
4. Action: Start a program
5. Program: `powershell.exe`
6. Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\OutlookAutoArchive.ps1"`

## How It Works

1. **Connects to Outlook**: Uses COM Interop to access Outlook
2. **Finds Archive Folder**: Searches for Archive folder in multiple locations:
   - `Inbox\Archive`
   - Root-level `Archive`
   - Gmail-style `OutlookArchive`
3. **Creates Folder Structure**: Automatically creates year/month folders
4. **Scans Inbox**: Processes all emails in the Inbox
5. **Moves Old Emails**: Moves emails older than retention period to appropriate archive folder
6. **Logs Everything**: Records all operations to timestamped log files

## Archive Structure

The script creates an organized folder structure:

```
Archive/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024-01/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024-02/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2023/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2023-12/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Logging

Logs are stored in: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\OutlookAutoArchiveLogs\`

Each run creates a timestamped log file: `ArchiveLog_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.txt`

Log entries include:

- Configuration settings
- Folder creation operations
- Email movement details
- Errors and warnings
- Completion timestamp

## Safety Features

- **Dry-Run Mode**: Test without making changes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids moving duplicate emails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing folders or permissions
- **Backup Logging**: All operations are logged before execution

## Customization

### Adding Skip Rules

To skip specific emails, add rules to the `config.json` file:

```json
"SkipRules": [
    {
        "Mailbox": "Your Mailbox Name",
            "Subjects": [
                "Subject Pattern 1",
                "Subject Pattern 2"
            ]
    }
]
```

The script will automatically skip emails that match the specified mailbox and subject patterns.

### Custom Archive Locations

The script automatically detects archive folders in multiple locations:

- `Inbox\Archive`
- Root-level `Archive`
- Custom Gmail labels (configured via `GmailLabel` in config.json)

To add support for additional locations, modify the `Get-ArchiveFolder` function in the script.

### Setting Up Gmail Labels

If you're using Gmail with Outlook, you can create custom labels for archiving:

#### In Gmail:
1. **Create a Label**:
   - Open Gmail in your web browser
   - Click the gear icon (Settings) ‚Üí "See all settings"
   - Go to the "Labels" tab
   - Click "Create new label"
   - Name it (e.g., "OutlookArchive" or your preferred name)
   - Click "Create"

2. **Label Structure** (Optional):
   - You can create nested labels like "OutlookArchive/2024/2024-12"
   - The script will automatically create year/month sub-labels

#### In Outlook:
1. **Sync the Label**:
   - The Gmail label should automatically appear in Outlook
   - It may take a few minutes to sync
   - Look for the label in your folder list

2. **Configure the Script**:
   - Set `GmailLabel` in your `config.json` to match your Gmail label name
   - Example: `"GmailLabel": "OutlookArchive"`

#### Troubleshooting Gmail Labels:
- **Label not appearing**: Try refreshing Outlook or restarting it
- **Sync issues**: Check your Gmail IMAP settings in Outlook
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you have full access to your Gmail account

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access Denied" errors**: Ensure Outlook is running and you have permissions
2. **No Archive folder found**: Create an Archive folder in your Inbox or root level
3. **Script won't run**: Check PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
4. **Config file not found**: Ensure `config.json` exists in the same directory as the script
5. **Invalid JSON**: Check that your `config.json` file has valid JSON syntax

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by adding `-Verbose` to PowerShell commands or modifying the script to include more detailed output.
